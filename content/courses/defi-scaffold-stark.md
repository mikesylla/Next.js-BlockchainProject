# Building DeFi Applications with Scaffold-Stark

DeFi is revolutionizing finance, and StarkNet provides the perfect platform for building scalable DeFi applications.

## Why StarkNet for DeFi?

- **Low fees**: Significantly cheaper than Ethereum mainnet
- **High throughput**: Handle more transactions per second
- **Security**: Inherit Ethereum's security through validity proofs

## Project Overview

We'll build a simple DEX (Decentralized Exchange) with:
- Token swapping
- Liquidity pools
- Yield farming

## Getting Started

```bash
npx create-scaffold-stark defi-dapp
cd defi-dapp
```

## Core Contracts

### Token Contract
```cairo
#[starknet::contract]
mod ERC20Token {
    // Implementation details
}
```

### DEX Contract
```cairo
#[starknet::contract]
mod SimpleDEX {
    // Swap and liquidity logic
}
```

## Frontend Integration

The Scaffold-Stark frontend automatically generates UI components for your contracts:

```typescript
const { writeAsync: swap } = useContractWrite({
  address: dexAddress,
  functionName: "swap",
  args: [tokenA, tokenB, amount],
});
```

## Testing

```bash
npm run test
```

## Deployment

```bash
npm run deploy
```

## Conclusion

Scaffold-Stark makes DeFi development on StarkNet incredibly efficient. The framework handles the complexity while you focus on your business logic.
