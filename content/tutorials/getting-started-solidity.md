# Getting Started with Solidity Smart Contracts

Welcome to the world of smart contract development! In this tutorial, we'll walk through the basics of Solidity and deploy your first contract.

## What You'll Learn

- Solidity syntax and data types
- Writing your first smart contract
- Deploying to a testnet
- Interacting with your contract

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have:
- Basic programming knowledge (preferably JavaScript)
- Understanding of blockchain concepts
- MetaMask wallet installed

## Setting Up Your Environment

First, let's set up Hardhat for development:

```bash
npm init -y
npm install --save-dev hardhat
npx hardhat
```

## Your First Contract

Let's create a simple storage contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SimpleStorage {
    uint256 private storedData;
    
    function set(uint256 x) public {
        storedData = x;
    }
    
    function get() public view returns (uint256) {
        return storedData;
    }
}
```

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've written your first smart contract. In the next tutorial, we'll explore more advanced Solidity features.
