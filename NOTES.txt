The next logical step would be **creating a comprehensive search page** that allows users to search across all content types (posts, tutorials, courses) from a single interface.

This would include:

- A dedicated `/search` page with advanced filtering options
- Global search functionality that searches titles, content, tags, and metadata across all three content types
- Combined results display showing mixed content types with visual differentiation
- Advanced filters like date ranges, content type toggles, blockchain platform filters, and difficulty levels
- Search result highlighting and pagination
- Recent searches and suggested searches functionality

This makes sense as the next step because:
1. You now have all the basic CRUD operations working
2. Individual page search/filtering is implemented
3. Users need a way to discover content across the entire site
4. It leverages all the components and API routes you've already built

This would significantly improve user experience by making your growing content library more discoverable and providing a central hub for content exploration.
